    Memorial, One World Observatory, Madison Square Garden, Rockefeller Center, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Bridge,
    DUMBO, Hudson Yards, the Highline, Grand Central Terminal, Museum of Natural History, Central Park, Lion King‚Ä¶ and
    so much more in between! The weather was beautiful and we had the best time exploring.</p><p>We could not have fit
    so much into this trip if it weren‚Äôt for Daniel Ellis with Show Me Tours planning our entire trip start to finish!
    He booked our accommodations, purchased all of our tickets, and gave us a step by step itinerary (literally like 10+
    pages). We spent an entire day with Daniel‚Äôs good friend and fellow tour guide, Bob, and the time spent alone we
    were confident in our plans because of Daniel‚Äôs attention to detail and directions to help us from point A to point
    B.</p><p>If you‚Äôre planning a trip to NYC and aren‚Äôt super familiar with the city, consider having Daniel organize
    your trip. We missed having him there with us in person this time, but appreciated having him there in spirit!
